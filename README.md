# deliverable-project
School project of class "DATA506". The point of the project is to demonstrate abilities of cleaning and analyzing data. I chose the public data of Airbnb "New York City Airbinb Open Data" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).

Short describtion about dataset:

 There are 48895 rows and 16 columns
 
 Columns from 1 to 4 are categorical nominal, they are clarifying each house/apartment
 and owners. Columns 5 and 6 contain borough and neighborhood of each of those boroughs. 7
 and 8 are latitude and longitude, they are useful for the case I'd like to make a
 geographical plot. Next columns are room type, price, minimum nights etc. Overall dataset
 has 4 nominal, 3 categorical, 2 continuous, 6 discrete, and 1 variable that contains
 dates.
